**1. Discuss the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating responsive web pages. Explain the significance of asynchronous programming in improving web page load times and user experience. (4 marks)**

**2. Explain how slow page loading can impact user engagement and suggest web programming techniques to improve it. (2 marks)**\
Slow page loading can negatively impact user engagement due to the inability to instantaneously access the information that they need.
Some web programming techniques to mitigate this include minifying images, optimising code and investing in more powerful server hardware.

**3. Explain two benefits of HTML and CSS in web development. Provide an example of how they work together to structure and style a webpage. (4 marks)**

**4. Outline what JavaScript is and how it enhances the functionality of a webpage. Provide an example where JavaScript is used to validate user input on a web form. (2 marks)**

**5. Discuss the importance of optimising webpage load time for user experience. Provide three techniques to improve the loading speed of a website. (2 marks)**\
Optimising webpage load times dramatically enhances user experience, as it enables the user to access the information that they need almost immediately. This ensures user satisfaction as the page loads and responds quickly.
Three techniques to improve the loading speed of a website are minifying images, optimising code and investing in more powerful server hardware.

**6. Explain how the CSS Flexbox layout works. Provide a simple example of how you would use Flexbox to create a row of three equal-width boxes that adapt to the screen size. You may include a diagram and annotation. (4 marks)**

**7. Why is web accessibility important, and what are the two best practices developers should follow to ensure their websites are accessible to all users? Provide examples for each best practice. (2 marks)**\
Web accessibility is important because it encourages the development of higher-quality webpages, driven by the need to make them accessible to everyone.
Two best practices developers should follow are adhering to the W3C and I18N standards.
For example, including an accessible layout as per the guidelines of the I18N ensures the quality of a website as enables more people to access the same content.

**8. Discuss the importance of cross-browser compatibility. (3 marks)**\
Cross-browser compatibility is extremely important as it enables everyone to access the same content in their own way. 
This is because different browsers use different rendering engines, so ensuring that web applications function the same across all browsers enables everyone to view the same content.
For example, if a webpage only functioned as intended on Google Chrome, then those who choose to use other browsers would not be able to access the website in the same way.

**9. Explain the use of the <canvas> tag in HTML design? Give an example. (2 marks)**\
The <canvas> tag creates a canvas within the HTML file that allows graphics to be drawn over it.

**10. Justify why the World Wide Web wasn’t ‘designed’ to be ‘secure’ when it first emerged in the 1980s. (5 marks)**
There are some reasons why the World Wide Web wasn’t designed to be secure when it first emerged. These are:
1. The web was originally designed for a small and trusted community of users. This meant that security was not a major concern. The initial structure of the web was based on the assumption of trust.
2. The creators of the web did not think that activities like shopping, banking or sensitive communications would be done on their platform so there were no initial security measures for such actions.
3. Originally, the web was designed for quick and efficient data sharing, leading to development of protocols without security features e.g. HTTP. Security features were added later as vulnerabilities emerged.
4. The web’s architecture was originally designed to be open, decentralised and flexible. Security mechanisms were complex, and potentially slowed down adoption while the internet was still growing, had they been implemented.
